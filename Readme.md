# “Floyd of Death” - ffj_chuma

Map for Quake mod “Alkaline”, intended for Quake event “Floyd jam”
### Author info

- Map name : Floyd of Death
- Mod: Alkaline v1.2.2e (devkit version) .
- Author : Chuma.
### General Information

For a while i’ve been looking to make a map for fun, Alkaline being selected for this jam gave me the opportunity to make an amazing joke entry, coming from Doom mapping i wanted to recreate a Doom map, Doom 2’s original Circle of Death was selected for this map, then i proceded to use a mix of Quake and Doom textures for it… i had a lot of fun just releasing this map.

In order to complete it, play it as intended like the original Doom map, there are no surprises unless you try to speedrun.

A cool fact would be that originally in the place of the Laser Canon there was Alkaline’s Plasma Rifle, due to the tankiness of the Floyds i replaced it… and also the final battle placement was switched… Those Arachnofloyd jumping still scare me… Also the Nailgun was replaced with the SNG since most of the battles are close encountered (with a little bit more of ammo given).

Track used : The healer stalks - Andrew Hulshult (IDKFA Album). (Approved the use of the track by him… thanks man!)

Ogg conversion of the track by Phoenyx.
